`cdc-preload` is a utility tool designed to perform initial data loading (preload) from a source database (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle) to a target system before starting a Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline.
It ensures the target system is pre-populated with existing records, allowing CDC tools like Debezium to capture only subsequent changes.
